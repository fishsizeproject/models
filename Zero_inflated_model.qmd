## Introduction

Most fisheries datasets (scientific, commercial, recreational) have a lot of zero catches. These are trips were no fish was caught. These zero catches are important but we need to fit appropriate models to accommodate them. Here we are introducing a model for zero inflated data. For a basic introduction into the model and data, check out [**these slides**](resources/ZeroInflatedModels.pdf). To learn more about the data we strongly recommend that you watch at least [**part 4**](https://fishsizeproject.github.io/CPUEcourse/4-hilsha.html) of our CPUE standardisation course.  

Before proceeding with CPUE standardisation, first make sure you carefully *assess and explore your data*. We have prepared two courses and different scripts for data exploration, which you can find on our [CPUE standardisation course](https://fishsizeproject.github.io/CPUEcourse/) webpage.

## Model code

The main model code is available in this [**R markdown script**](scripts/Hilsha.Rmd) and is demonstrated using [**this dataset**](scripts/hilsa.csv). You can download the model and modify the script according to your needs. Also, [**here**](resources/Hilsha.html) you want to look at the model code and outputs without having to run the code.

## Application of the model 

To better understand this model and its applications, we strongly recommend that you go through our [**CPUE standardisation course**](https://fishsizeproject.github.io/CPUEcourse/) material, where we discuss different models and their strengths in greater detail.
