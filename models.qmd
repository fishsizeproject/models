We have developed and applied a range of statistical and mechanistic models, which we used in our studies and are happy to share with others. We hope these models will be useful for fisheries research and management. The models are available for free non-commercial use, but please reference the original source (publications or this website).

## Models for catch per unit effort (CPUE) standardisation

Scientific monitoring and artisanal, commercial or recreational fish catch data is often used to assess population status and trends, but such data are usually complex and require careful standardisation. There are several approaches that can be used for CPUE standardisation and we present three potential models of increasing complexity.

Generalized linear model (GLM) based standardisation](GLM_standardisation.qmd) <br> This model could be used for scientific monitoring or commercial catch data and applies GLM with Tweedie distribution to extract annual CPUE residuals.

## Surplus production models for stock assessments

Surplus production (SP) models are commonly used to assess data-poor fish stocks and are based on time series of catches and population abundance index (such as standardised CPUE time series, from the models above). These models assume that fish population abundance depends on its regeneration rate, carrying capacity and catches. SP models have been successfully applied to many stocks and, despite their simple assumptions, often perform surprisingly well, assuming the population abundance and catch time series are reliable.

See how sustainable yield will depend on population regeneration and fishing mortality rate. See how catching more fish sometimes can give you less long term yield.

## Fish growth models

Fish growth and therefore body sizes are highly variable, as it depends on temperature, food availability and many other processes. Understanding and modelling how and why growth can change is therefore an important part of fisheries research.

## Satellite data analysis

Remote sensing and satellite data is now being collected on high temporal and spatial resolution. However, it is often challenging to access and process these data. We have developed some models and tools to aid with satellite based water surface temperature and chlorophyll A data acquisition and analysis.
