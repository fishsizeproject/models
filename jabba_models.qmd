## Introduction 

JABBA is a Bayesian State-Space Surplus Production Model framework developed by [Winker et al. 2018](resources/Winker2018.pdf).

It uses catch and relative abundance time series and requires prior information on a) the resilience parameter r (intrinsic rate of population increase), b) carrying capacity K and c) the relative initial biomass at the beginning of the time series. 

You can find all information in the developers' [**vignette**]

## Model code 

[**Here**](scripts/jabba.Rmd) is an example code of how we used JABBA for modeling five species in the Curonian Lagoon and Kaunas water reservoir (Lithuania).

## Application of the model

To learn more about surplus production modeling to Curonian Lagoon and Kaunas Water Reservoir fish stocks and results that could be of interest to managers, you can read [this](resources/KM_jabba_rez.pdf) and [this](resources/Kaunas_jabba_rez.pdf) summary or watch [**this conference talk**](youtube%20link).
