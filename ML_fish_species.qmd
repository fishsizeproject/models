## Introduction

Here we present a **scalable user-friendly artificial intelligence (AI) framework to develop fish species identification models**. We have prepared a course and scripts for data pre-processing, image processing and machine learning model development, which you can find on our [Online course](https://fishsizeproject.github.io/Course-MLforImageProcessing/) webpage. 

In this [**publication**](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/21/14324) in the journal *Sustainability* you will find a detailed description of the framework, a pilot case-study where we demonstrate potential use for recreational fisheries research, a summary of the knowledge gained from the case study application and an outline of the main challenges and potential future development. You can also find all the scripts used in the framework in our [Github page](https://github.com/fishsizeproject/ML-framework-for-image-processing).

## Model code

To use our models it is very important that fish species (or ecotypes or any other classes you want your model to identify) in your dataset are identified correctly, otherwise your model will not be very useful (you might have heard the expression “garbage in - garbage out”). You can upload images (in JPEG or PNG format) to your Google drive by species (i.e. one species per folder - please make sure these are correctly identified), following this directory structure:
